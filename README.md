=======

This is a [demo web app](http://andlum.github.io/caliper/) that calculates the distance between American airports in nautical miles using [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geometry), jQuery, and [airport JSON data](https://gist.github.com/tdreyno/4278655) from [Thomas Reynolds](https://github.com/tdreyno).
